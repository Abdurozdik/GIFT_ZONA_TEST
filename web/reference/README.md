# Reference Files

This folder contains reference files from CSGOPositive for development purposes.

## Files:
- `csgopositive.css` - Original CSS file (35,707 lines) for reference only
- **DO NOT IMPORT** these files in the project
- Use only for extracting specific styles and measurements

## Usage:
1. Open `csgopositive.css` to find specific CSS rules
2. Extract only needed styles to our own CSS files
3. Copy exact measurements, colors, and positioning
4. Keep this as reference for pixel-perfect design

## Important:
- These files are NOT part of the build process
- They are for development reference only
- Never import in index.css or components
